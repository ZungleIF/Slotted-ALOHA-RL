#Slotted ALOHA Reinforcement Learning


This project is an approach to make Slotted ALOHA more efficient with causing less collisions
by using two different methods of Reinforcement Learning:

 - Monte-Carlo (Included in `RL.cpp`)
 - Temporal Difference (Included in `TD.cpp`)
 
##Dependencies
 - `eigen`
 - `matplotlib-cpp`
